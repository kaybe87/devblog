	    <p class = "blog-entry">So far it seems that my interests are most targetted towards HTML. I have been enjoying it more than Python and SQL. I think the reasoning behind that would really be that its quite simple and you can get
	  results quickly. It is also easily applicable to real life situations as we see right here. There is an instant way to apply HTML to a real life scenario and make it more real than just learning concepts.
	  I am excited to see where learning the rest of HTML and learning CSS really takes my ability with this little blog. It would be awesome to be able to use this as a portfolio example. I am going to take screenshots along
	  the way so I can see the progress as I make it.</p>

	    <p class = "blog-entry">I can already say that the more I learn, the more I want to learn. I feel proud of what I have been able to make to far, but it's really something along the lines of what you might expect
	  from a high school freshman on their first week of class. This is not something that is going to stop me though. I had no desire to boot up steam or battle.net today. The thing I wanted to do after work was
	  log into code-academy and learn. I am really excited to see where this road leads. <br /> <br /> P.S. I added a home page but its so bad I don't want to add a screenshot of it yet!</p>
	 
	  
	    <h3 class = "ssdate">September 19th, 2017: Playing with the Box Model A Bit</h3>
	    <a href = "https://puu.sh/xE22L/3ada094e91.png" target ="_blank"><img src="https://puu.sh/xE22L/3ada094e91.png" style="width:384px;height:216px;"></a>
	    <p class = "blog-entry">I can definitely see the applications for advanced CSS and gaining more knowledge of the box model. Only one screenshot today as the changes were largely applied to all existing pages.
	  CSS is still pretty fun. I feel like I could take the knowledge of it that I have gained already and make a halfway decent looking page (along with snagging some references and items on google), but I think
	  I will stick to the course outline. I know these blog entries are small and maybe pointless but seeing even just a little progress every day feels good.</p>

	    <p class = "blog-entry">Just a quick entry before bed. Went back and did some HTML projects and it was nice to re-use the code from a week ago and apply some new CSS to it.</p>
